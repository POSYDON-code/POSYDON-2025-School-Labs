    "* Learn how to pick out subpopulations\n",
    "* Analyze the binaries in your subpopulation, understand their evolution history and formation channels\n",

    "In this lab we are going to look at a much larger population than what we have done so far. The population that we will look at consists of 1,000,000 binaries and although you now know how to run a population like this yourself, it can take something like an hour to run on an HPC facility, depending on available resources. So, we'll simply load in a pre-run population and analyze it below -- we'll keep things simple for now and stick to one metallicity, but later on in this lab you will see how to work with a multi-metallicity population. First up, let's import the `Population` class so that we can begin our analysis.\n",

    "# 1. Managing Large Binary Populations\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have alluded to, you will probably be running much larger populations than what we have been running when you use POSYDON in your own research. This is essential in order to get realistic statistics on the populations that you might be interested in. So, we will get some practice now how to handle very large populations. In the last lab, you may have gotten to the point of running a population on an HPC system. This essentially picks up from that point, but we will pretend that you ran a population of 1 million stars (even this is on the smaller side in comparison to real stellar populations in nature). Running populations this large will usually require HPC usage (unless you have a lot of time or a very fast PC!). On quest, a population this size completed within a few hours, but this timeframe can be more or less depending on your available system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, much of what you have seen already applies here as well -- just everything is bigger. Also, since we're using more than 10 or 100 stars, we can start to see some accurate physical results, based on the underlying physical assumptions made in POSYDON.\n",
