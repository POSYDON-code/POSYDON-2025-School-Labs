    "# Lab 1: Multi-Metallicity Populations, Transient Populations, and Initial Conditions Reweighting\n",
    "#### Mike Zevin, Monica Gallegos-Garcia\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn how to combine runs at different metallicities\n",
    "* Explore how predicted source properties vary across metallicity\n",
    "* Create transient populations using POSYDON\n",
    "* Learn how to reweight populations with different initial conditions assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to begin our exploration of multi-metallicity populations. Metallicity has a major impact on the evolution of massive stars, the transients they generate, and the compact objects they leave behind. Non-local astrophysical sources and transients generally occur at a range of metallicities; for transients that we observe over a large range of redshift, we are observing the universe at a wide range of times and metal content. Thus, when investigating cosmological rates and population properties of astrophysical events (e.g., gravitational-wave sources, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae), taking into account the metallicity evolution of the universe is imperative. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the first lab, we will be exploring how POSYDON compiles and handles populations at various metallicities. We will be using POSYDON populations of 10,000 binaries at 8 discrete metallicities. We will also learn about a nifty tool in POSYDON that allows us reweight populations based on different initial condition assumptions, which means you can explore different initial condition assumptions without rerunning entire populations!\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Compiling populations run at different metallicities\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by reading in the populations that were run at 8 discrete metallicities. For completeness, below is the script that copied over and edited the default initialization file, and ran the populations. These populations took about 10 hours total on a single processor --- not too bad but probably not something you want to do right now! Following this cell, we can just read in the pre-computed populations. "
