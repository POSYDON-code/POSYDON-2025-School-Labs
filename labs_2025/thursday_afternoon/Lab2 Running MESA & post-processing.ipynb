    "The building blocks of POSYDON are the grids of single star and binary MESA simulations.\n",
    "Since we need large grids for each phase, the ease of setting up MESA simulations is an integral part of the POSYDON infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most population synthesis science cases, the POSYDON default grids might be enough.\n",
    "But as we start to link more and more population properties to intrinsic stellar and binary physics, additional grids will become more important in our understanding of stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this practicum we're specifically going to focus on running a \"grid\" of single stars and binaries, and how you can change their physics.\n",
    "Because an actual grid run can take several days to complete based on the number of runs, we are going to submit only a few (or a couple) binaries and single stars to show you the process of submission and post-processing.\n",
    "The main steps in this practicum are:\n",
    "1. Setting up a grid run with the POSYDON inlists.\n",
    "2. Adding your own MESA inlist changes on top of the POSYDON ones (this is no MESA summer school though, so nothing too complex)\n",
    "3. Submitting the grid runs to the cluster.\n",
    "4. Using pre-ran MESA simulations, we will explore the creation of the `PSyGrid` files, downsampling, and general post-proceesing of these single star and binary runs.\n",
