    "# Simulating the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of an X-ray binary (XRB) population\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous labs, you explored populations of double compact object mergers, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts. These phenomena are instantaneous transient events: they occur on timescales much shorter than the typical lifetime of a binary system. Within the POSYDON framework, such events can be modeled efficiently using an initial–final interpolation scheme, which maps the initial binary properties directly to their final, post-event outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "X-ray binaries, however, are fundamentally different. They represent evolutionary phases of binary systems that persist for a non-negligible fraction of the system’s lifetime. During these phases, the properties of the binaries—such as component masses, orbital periods, and X-ray luminosities—evolve continuously with time. Because of this temporal evolution, an initial–final interpolation approach is not sufficient to capture their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling strategies for X-ray binary populations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two principal approaches to model populations of systems like X-ray binaries:\n",
    "1.  Snapshot method\n",
    "-   Evolve each binary up to a pre-specified age.\n",
    "-   Record its properties at that moment.\n",
    "-   If the binary is in an X-ray phase at that time, include it in the population statistics.\n",
    "2.  Full evolutionary history method (Lab2)\n",
    "-   Evolve each binary from zero-age to the end of its life.\n",
    "-   Identify all intervals during which the system qualifies as an X-ray binary.\n",
    "-   Record the evolving properties of the system across these intervals, weighting them by the time spent in each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"snapshot\" method is conceptually straightforward but computationally inefficient: a binary may have been an X-ray source at earlier or later times, and its observable properties evolve during the X-ray phase, which is not fully captured by a single snapshot. This \"full evolutionary history\" method is more computationally efficient and captures the temporal evolution of the population in greater detail. It is however conceptualy more complex to implement.\n",
