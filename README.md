# POSYDON-2025-School-Labs

These are coding exercises from the [POSYDON School 2025](https://posydon.org/posydon-school-2025/). These are aimed to teach users how to use populaiton synthesis code [POSYDON](https://posydon.org/POSYDON/latest/index.html) for astrophysics research. We recommend going day by day, starting with the labs from Tuesday morning to learn the basics -- or if you are already familiar with POSYDON, jump in wherever suits your needs.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of these labs rely on pre-made population data to work. The requisite population data can be downloaded from Zenodo here: [https://zenodo.org/records/17902460](https://zenodo.org/records/17902460). By default, the labs expect these to be place in your `$PATH_TO_POSYDON_DATA` directory, which is an environment variable set up during the [POSYDON installation process](https://posydon.org/POSYDON/latest/getting-started/installation-guide.html).
