# POSYDON-2025-School-Labs

These are coding exercises from the [POSYDON School 2025](https://posydon.org/posydon-school-2025/). These are aimed to teach users how to use populaiton synthesis code [POSYDON](https://posydon.org/POSYDON/latest/index.html) for astrophysics research. We recommend going day by day, starting with the labs from Tuesday morning to learn the basics -- or if you are already familiar with POSYDON, jump in wherever suits your needs.
